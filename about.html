    <p><b>.Trevor Noah</b> first born child to his black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father,him being born
    in a wrong world where he could not be,the story is much of his mistirious life and a family that
    was never ment to be a family but then who to <br>be blamed,no one knows

    ."Whilst my mother couldn't give me access to world,she at least made sure to me know it existed.A kid cannot<br>
     dream of being an astronats if he does not know about"
    .And why does he says he was born a crime.?
    <p>.The novel explains well  how patricia was not the right woman to Abel,their marriage life <br>was the 
    worst to trevor,as Abel could marry a traditional wife but he got patricia as he wanted a free wife
    uwhom he could gauge...“He only wants a woman who is free because his dream <br>is to put her in a cage.”
    thats what <br>she use to say.
    In Tsonga culture that is,it was extremely patriarchal where women must bow when greet men,men and women had limited social interaction and they did <br>not share responsibilities at any point.That was not the case in Patricia's view
    And much shows how Patricia was so cool and determined lady ,she never gave up on Abel despite all the troubles she was in to ,she made him stop smoking weed after they<br>
        got married because of religious region,though he went ahead and drunk too much but Patricia was still.
        Abel could have married a traditional wife whom could fit into his life not<br> as like Patricia made it hard,them fighting every now and then thus because Patricia was a modern woman..
