       that you'll get to see the true colours of people who say they care about you.Notice who stick around you and those who doesn't ,and be greatful<br>
       to those who leave you ,for they have given you a room to grow in the space they abandoned,and the awareness to appreciate the people who losed <br>
       you when you didn't feel lovable.
